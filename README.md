**Research Lab.** My [group](https://iol.zib.de/) is interested in Artificial Intelligence, Optimization, and Machine Learning. We develop new methodologies (e.g., new optimization and learning algorithms), work on combining learning and decision-making, as well as design AI Systems for real-world deployment in various application contexts.
